# Browser Matrix

A pure JavaScript browser visualisation tool. It uses Google's client side
OAuth implementation to log you into your Google Analytics profile so that you
can see information about the browsers your users use.

You can use the tool without any installation here:
[edds.github.io/browser-matrix](http://edds.github.io/browser-matrix)

## Installation

You will need to create a new API token in the [Google APIs Console][1]. You
should then place that token in the settings section of `index.html`. Launching
`index.html` in your browser should then let you use the tool.
